        title:"What is your average project price?",
        content:"There is no set price that I charge for projects. It all comes down to the cilents needs and wants. So if you’re curious about how much a project costs you can send me a message, and we can discuss in detail. I won’t bite I promise!"

        title:"What is included in a new project?",
        content: "When starting a new project, a few key components are always included. First, the inevitable excitement comes with starting something new. This is closely followed by a period of intense planning, in which every detail is meticulously mapped out. After that comes the hard work of executing the plan, and finally, the sense of satisfaction that comes with completing the project."

        title:"Can you make the logo bigger?",
        content:"As any designer knows, the size of a logo can be a sensitive issue. After all, the client is the one who has to live with the final product, and they may have strong opinions about how big or small the logo should be. Ultimately, it's up to the designer to balance meeting the client's needs and creating a logo that looks good and functions well. So if anyone comes to you and asks, 'Can you make the logo bigger?' just take a deep breath and remember that it's not always about size."
