                    <p>GIFs have been used to express emotion, as well as to demonstrate things in an easy-to-understand way. They're so visual and easy to understand; GIFs are a great way to communicate complex ideas. An excellent way to deliver complex messages quickly and concisely.</p>

                    <h3>UX Research</h3>
                    <p>I conducted interviews asking participants asking them to state their experiences receiving marketing materials from brands, a lot of them probably couldnâ€™t even remember the contents of such materials, user although found it easier to recall images they could have seen while going through them and felt more connected to the brand personally when GIFs were used, they were also convicted that the company were much more intentional about convicting them. This lead to increase in open and click in the majority of the users and increase in conversion rate.</p>
