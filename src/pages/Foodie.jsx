                    <p>Foodie is a mobile application that allows for users to order meals from their favorite restaurants and have them delivered in no time at all. Our priorities for this project where majorly quality and speed.</p>

                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>I carried out to the end-to-end process for this project, from the research stages to the final design stage. I worked alone on this as a UX Research and UI Designer.</p>

                    <p>A lot of the time people are really busy and do not have the time to cook meals or go to a restaurant. As a User Experience designer, the problem here was to find a unique solution that helps these people get meals quickly and easily.</p>

                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p>My main goal was to design an accessible and inclusive mobile app that's allows users to order meals at their own convenience.

                            <li>Large selection of meals and restaurants</li>

                    <h3>UX Research</h3>
                    <p>I conducted interviews asking participants what their experiences were using similar platforms that provided such services, after which I  created empathy maps to understand the users I‚Äôm designing for and their needs. A large number of users were working adults who don‚Äôt have time to cook meals. </p>
                <div className="list">
                    <p>From my research I also discovered that other factors such as obligations, interests, or challenges that make it difficult to get groceries for cooking or go to restaurants in-person.</p>

                    <p>A prototype version of the application was given to users to test and complete a delivery task on the application, this was a timed test as our desired time was set to 10¬†mins, I noticed that 75% of users that are familiar with these platforms completed this task in less than 10¬†mins, while the rest completed in more than 10¬†mins but less than 15.
